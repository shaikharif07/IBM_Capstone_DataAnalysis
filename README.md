Cousera final project for data analysis

**Title:** IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project: Analyzing Emerging Skills in the IT Industry

**Project Overview:**
As a Data Analyst hired by a global IT and business consulting services firm, you are tasked with analyzing data from various sources to identify trends and insights related to emerging skills in the IT industry. The project aims to understand future skill requirements in the rapidly evolving technological landscape.

**Project Tasks:**

Collecting data from diverse sources (job postings, training portals, surveys) to gather information on the top programming skills in demand.
Analyzing the collected data to identify trends, such as popular programming languages, database skills, and preferred IDEs.
Preparing the collected data for analysis through data wrangling techniques, including cleaning, transforming, and organizing the data.
Applying statistical techniques to explore relationships and gain deeper insights from the data.
Creating interactive dashboards using IBM Cognos Analytics for visually appealing and user-friendly data presentation.
Developing a compelling presentation to effectively communicate findings and recommendations based on the data analysis.
Evaluation:
Your performance will be evaluated through quizzes and a final project presentation, ensuring your technical skills, as well as your ability to communicate and visualize data-driven insights.

**Repository Structure:**
The repository contains separate notebooks representing each step of the data analysis process, along with supplementary files to support the notebooks.

**Getting Started:**
1) Clone the repository to your local machine.
2) Review the provided notebooks and additional files to understand the project's workflow and requirements.
3) Set up the necessary environment with required libraries and dependencies.
4) Follow the notebooks in order, executing code cells and following instructions.
5) Take quizzes to assess your understanding and progress.
6) Summarize key findings and recommendations for the final project presentation.
